Great job! To handle this exercise, you can follow these steps:

Switch to the update_script branch using the command git checkout update_script.

Create an empty file named 98 in the bash directory using the command touch bash/98.

Update the bash/alx file by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School" using a text editor or the command sed -i 's/ALX/ALX School/g' bash/alx.

Update the bash/school file by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!" using a text editor or the command sed -i 's/School/The school is open!/g' bash/school.

Add the changes using the command git add ..

Commit the changes with the message "My personal work" using the command git commit -m "My personal work".

Push the new branch to the origin using the command git push -u origin update_script.

Switch to the main branch using the command git checkout main.

Update the bash/alx file by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!" using a text editor or the command sed -i 's/ALX/ALX School is so cool!/g' bash/alx.

Delete the js directory using the command rm -r js.

Add the changes using the command git add ..

Commit the changes with the message "Hot fix" using the command git commit -m "Hot fix".

Push the changes to the origin using the command git push origin main.

Now your changes are committed and pushed to the main branch, and your hot fix has been deployed. Congratulations!
